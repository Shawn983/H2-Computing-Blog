  <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
  <input type="image" id="image" src="code-1839406_640.jpg">
  <p>Firstly, I learnt how to use HTML in H2 computing. Many of the things I learnt are the different basics commands of HTML/CSS such as how to bold text, inserting texts, changing the font colour,background colour and more.It was very interesting and fulfilling to learn how to use HTML and CSS, as I can now create my own websites and webpages,just like this one. I have never learnt this previously, so I feel very good that I have manged to pick it up now. </p>
  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>After HTML and CSS, python was taught to us in H2 computing. Python is a very beginner-friendly,fun and efficient language to learn, so I was very glad to be able to learn it.I had some python experience prior to this, so I could understand all the python commands that were taught, such as f-strings,printing as well as inputing integers in. It was quite a good experience and I hope to learn more python in future lessons. </p>
    <h2>Competitions and other Events</h2>

    <h3>NOI Competition</h3>
    <p>I managed to get a chance to participate in the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) competition this year. It was my first time ever participating in this competition, so I really did not know what to expect when I went into the competition. </p>
  <p>Initially, I managed to do 1 or 2 questions, but the scores did not register well in the system, as my code had either code errors or syntax errors. I was also at a slight disadvantage as I was using python instead of the recommended C++,which is what most NOI participants use, instead of python, although both are allowed. The 3rd-5th question really left me stumped, as I did not really understand them, and as a result could not really get the codes for them done in time. In the end, I did not manage to get past the qualification round, but I was still happy that I have learned a lot from that experience, and hope that I can do better for NOI next time.</p>
